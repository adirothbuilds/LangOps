# Alert Module Documentation

## Overview

The `alert` module provides alert templates and notification system components for LangOps. This module is designed to handle real-time error detection and multi-channel notifications.

## Components

### Registry

- [AlertRegistry](registry.md): Registry for managing alert classes and notification channels.

## Features

- **Real-time Error Detection**: Intelligent monitoring of log streams and pipeline status
- **Multi-channel Notifications**: Support for email, Slack, webhook, and custom channels
- **Template System**: Flexible alert templates for different error types and scenarios
- **Severity-based Routing**: Route alerts to appropriate channels based on severity level

## Usage

The alert module is currently in development with the following planned features:

```python
from langops.alert import AlertRegistry, BaseAlert

# Register custom alert handler
@AlertRegistry.register(name="slack_alert")
class SlackAlert(BaseAlert):
    def send(self, message, severity="INFO"):
        # Send alert to Slack channel
        pass

# Use alert system
alert = AlertRegistry.get_alert("slack_alert")
alert.send("Build failed with errors", severity="ERROR")
```

## Coming Soon

- **Email Notifications**: SMTP-based email alerts
- **Slack Integration**: Direct Slack channel notifications
- **Webhook Support**: HTTP webhook notifications for custom integrations
- **Alert Templates**: Pre-built templates for common DevOps scenarios
- **Severity Filtering**: Configure alert thresholds by severity level
